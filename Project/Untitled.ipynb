This is the # 1 world esports discipline! [/b]\\n\\nIt is difficult to evaluate this game somehow, since this is a part of my youth and the first steps in esports, when I was still 11-12 years old :)\\nAt that time, the sky was bluer, and the grass was greener, and the Orcs were no match for the present ... although what am I talking about .... it is from another….\\n\\n[b] The most important thing in this game is the Team and the Spirit that it contains! [/b]\\n\\nIt doesn't matter what is in your hands! It can be M4A1 and AK-47, or even an ordinary knife!\\nBut all this no longer makes sense when you feel like 1,000,000 eyes are looking at you online, and you need to defuse this bomb or detonate it, and then everything depends on your Team! \\nYou just go to Length and make a headshot, then make a minus from the Elephant and here it is! But do not forget to discard 2 Flashes on the Zigzag and make 2 more minuses from your Desert Eagle, and now you are left alone! And time goes by….\\n\\nYears of life pass in the same way, but you, as always, will love this game and smile after 10 -100 years when you see it :)\\nAnd, seeing how new gamers play something newer, smile with a grin behind their back and burn the same fire of Love for this world of video games for the rest of their lives!\\n\\nA few words about the technical capabilities of the game….\\nOver the past 10x years, the World has changed 10 times! But this game remained the same as it was in 1999-2000! \\nIf you want to see what the World was like then, and what it was like to live in the World of esports at the turn of 1000 years! Then you need to play this game for 1000 hours so that your eyes and hands and brain are immersed in this World and stay here forever with Love in your heart! \\nYes, there is a lot of something beyond new and amazing around, but why all this? \\nWhen you have your favorite game in your hands, and you see your favorite Team of friends on the monitor! \\n[b] But they are not so young anymore, so your girlfriend will be under the table :) [/b]\\n\\n100/100 HeadShots through the wall!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP.\\nAnd too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always,  GL & HF <3\",\n",

       "  'review': \"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best\\n\\ngame to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.\\n\\nIt starts off with a team trying to kill another team. \\n\\nI started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.\\n\\nThen I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.\\n\\nWhen I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.\\n\\nCS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.\\n\\nOver the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I am recommending this because of nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry.',\n",

       "  'review': '\"Lock and Load.\"\\n\"Go go go!\"\\n\"Fire in the hole!\"\\n\"The bomb has been planted.\"\\n\"Counter-terrorists/terrorists Win.\"\\n\\nIt is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercafés across the world. For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesn’t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike. \\n\\nOriginally a modification (mod in short) made for Valve’s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a “professional only” game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.\\n\\nGetting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Don’t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.\\n\\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don’t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.\\n\\nAs time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Throughout the years, Counter-Strike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with Half-Life and (maybe) Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike has not only helped Valve to thrive as a gaming company, but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.',\n",

       "  'review': \"It's a classic game. I heard about it from friends. Also from the geography from where I am, it'd've been very likely that local kids and young adults already knew about it when I was growing up. Loved it as a kid. Learned a lot from it as well not just as gameplay. Made a lot of friends. A big part of the local (nation-wide) community is like-minded. It brings nostalgia. Too bad that it's dying over the years. Everyone moves onto something else. Being able to create/modify your own mod boosted one's intelligence as a kid. To many, this was the beginning point of their career in programming. This wasn't/isn't just a game, it's way more than that. It's my childhood and so it is to many others - a treasure of memories. One could say it's the heart of FPS games. I wish I could turn back time and relive the moments. Even the boring time. Now I am a grown up. This game will be forever with me, I'll carry it in my heart. I hope to be able to share stories about it with my children and grand-children one day. No other game could match it. More than just computer code - a platform for friendship.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Counter Strike,\\n\\nA miracle of the FPS genre.\\n\\nGiving this game a score less than 10, will result in shame. Play this game, then play a modern FPS multiplayer game, and you will see that this game was the innovator. A deliverer of fine quick reflex shooting and an unlimited skill learning curve. A provider of that instant gratification kill which was solely based on skill. There are no perks, levels, experience points to give you the edge. You are either the best of the match, or you aren\\'t. You cant become \"level 100\" by just playing 15 hours a day like most modern day multiplayer shooters. When you die, you have to wait. This is the punishment. You wait, and watch, and learn your enemies tactics, and choice of weapons. You learn who\\'s the best, so that you can save that extra flash bang just for that sucker. This punishment is gives tremendous value to the kill. When the other player is dead, hes gone. He\\'s crying, lighting up a cigarette, going to the bathroom, watching how badass you are, or all of the above. He was eliminated, gone, for 10 minutes. The team tactics are a whole other story. If a team is being plastered by another team with more skilled players, it can make a comeback with team tactics. Team tactics are essential to the success of an average team. Also the level of modifications that this game offers cannot be overlooked. Every weapon has its own characteristics, and your fighting style must adapt to the weapon you have chosen. Yes this is also true with modern shooters, but CS emphasized this more. There are no cheap weapons, no grenade launchers or rocket launchers. Every weapon is completely balanced, and even a hand gun can do the trick if you know how to use it. There is no auto-aim (hello Halo and Call of Duty?) Its you, the mouse, the gun, the target retical, and your enemies face.\\n\\nThis game, is a perfect score of 10, and none less.',\n",

Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.\\n\\nReason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.\\n\\n\\nfunc_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.\\n\\nFind a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.\\n\\nYou can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?\\n\\nMods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...\\n\\nThere is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles. \\n\\n1337/10\\n\\nLeet crew 5 lyf\\n\\nKicks csgo's ass by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.\\n\\nP.S - CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!\\n\\nOh yeah, you don't have to pay to use sprays in this game either.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This is the game that started it all for me when it comes to PC gaming. When I was just 13 years old, I ran this game with just 512mb of ram and integrated graphics. I knew nothing about computers but that didn't matter. I loved the game for what it was and even the idea of talking to other players with a little desktop mic with a piece of tape stuck to the bottom of it fascinated me. Today, gamers take that stuff for granted, but I don't...not anymore. From the golden age of surf and every gamemode in-between, this version of Counter-Strike was the seed to a franchise that has stayed with me for over half of my life. While the franchise will continue to change, I will never forget it's roots and the special place that it became for me everyday after school. If you have never played Counter-Strike, consider this version if you are interested in something that will provide insight into how the game has become what it is today. Game on.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best\\n\\ngame to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.\\n\\nIt starts off with a team trying to kill another team.\\n\\nI started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.\\n\\nThen I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.\\n\\nWhen I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.\\n\\nCS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.\\n\\nOver the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).\",\n",
